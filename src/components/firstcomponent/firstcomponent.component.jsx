          On the top level, Puppy Culture is a
          <b> socialization <br /> and training program</b>
          specifically developed for puppies, from birth through the end of their critical socialization period. <br />
          <br />
          It includes age appropriate protocols and lessons laid out in an organized format. <br />
          <br />
          The program consists of videos, books and a Workbook, but that really does not get to the “why” of Puppy Culture, or what makes it different!

      <h2 className='text-center'>The Why of Puppy Culture</h2>
      <div className="main2 d-flex">
        <div className="para2 col-md-6">
          <br /> <br />
          Puppy Culture is based on the premise that the puppy always <br />
          leads the learning, and puppies learn best by appropriate <br />
          experiences at the appropriate time. <br />
          <br />
          So what we are doing is teaching you to observe the puppy, and, <br />
          based on the behavioral markers you see, serve the puppy the <br />
          experience or lesson that is optimal for him at that moment in
          <br /> time.

            alt="dogs" />
        </div>
        <div className="para1 col-md-6">
          By letting the puppy lead, we are:
          <li>Maximizing the benefit of any given protocol or lesson</li>
          <li>Minimizing any danger of over-facing or scaring the puppy</li>
          <li>Creating confidence and self-efficacy by presenting the appropriate level
            of challenge that the puppy CAN do without failing or presenting a danger to himself.</li>
          Finally, we teach owners to enjoy each puppy for the precious individual he is, and to bring out the best qualities in
          that puppy, rather than holding the puppy up to an arbitrary yardstick and labeling him as a problem if he does not measure up.

      <h2 className='text-center'> Appropriate Experiences at the Appropriate Time</h2>
      <br />
      <div className="main2 d-flex">
        <div className="para2 col-md-6">
          Many puppies are labeled as having behavior or temperament <br />
          issues when they are simply being served an inappropriate <br />
          experience for their developmental age.
          <br />
          <br />
          This can hobble the puppy for the rest of his life with an unjust <br />
          label that will cause people to treat him in an unthoughtful <br />
          manner. By letting the puppy lead, you avoid this and enjoy your puppy for the wonderful individual that he is.
          <br />
          <br />
          So you watch the puppy and see what learning experience he’s <br />
          ready for. And learning what those experiences are and how to <br />
          effectively serve them is a big part of the Puppy Culture <br />
          program.

            Why is this so important? Because things that are perfect in <br />
            one developmental period could be useless or even <br />
            detrimental in the next, and vice versa. So we teach you to <br />
            know where your puppy is developmentally, and what to do  <br />
            right now.
            <br />
            <br />
            Yes, Puppy Culture is a “positive,” reinforcement-based <br />
            program and we do not use corrections or outmoded <br />
            dominance theory, but that is really all a by-product of <br />
            observing the puppy and serving him the learning experience <br />
             he is asking for.
            <br />
            <br />
            And I will add that our program is based on the latest <br />
            science and studies on puppy and animal rearing, and we <br />
            include many experts and authors in the film to further <br />
            explain the logic of the program.
